//Prereqs: Students are familiar with creating a variable, storing something it it temporarily, and reassigning a new value to it. Students are in the middle of learning about 1D arrays so they have done some practice but it is still a concept that they are working on solidifying. Students have written a printArray method.

     Parameters:

     no return value since this is a void function -- but

    //Student-Prompt //I want the last piece of data to become the first (in the example, I want the 2 to become first). Let's try that:
    //FIRST_DRAFT
    // data[0] = data[data.length-1];
    // printArray(data);
    //What do you notice? What is it doing? (The 5 gets overwritten with a 2)
    //Why is this a problem?
    //We can't put the original first number in the last spot because we don't know what the original first number was anymore. It's been overwritten
    //MUST-ANSWER Q: How can we get around this problem of overwriting our data?
    //BIG IDEA: Store the original data in some sort of other variable to temporarily store data and then give it back to the user
    //FIRST-DRAFT
    //int[] placeholder  = new int[??];
    //Student-Prompt: How long should we make our placeholder array?
    //REVISION
    int[] placeholder  = new int[data.length];
    //We need to take every element in the list and put it into the placeholder list. How do we acces each element in the list? 
    //Student-Answer: use a for loop
    //we are using a for loop to traverse the list
    
    for (int i=0; i<data.length; i++){
      //Make chart of what array goes where for our example array which has 6 elements:
      //original index  Final index
      //0                5
      //1                4
      //2                3
      //3                2
      //etc
      //What do you notice about all these pairs? All add to 5. Why 5? That's the length -1.
      //DELIBERATE ERROR: Don't include the -1. Run the code to see what happens.
      placeholder[i] = data[data.length-i-1];//data.length-1 gives the last possible index. Subtracting i means the second index goes down while the first index goes up
